Project Brief: JournalMate

Overview:
We've developed the foundation for a minimalist, elegant voice recording application using Electron and React. The app features a dark mode interface with a simple, intuitive design focused on user experience.

Current Structure:
1. Main Components:
   - RecordButton: A prominent, circular button for starting/stopping recordings.
   - Sidebar: Navigation menu with links to main sections of the app.
   - Layout: Wrapper component that structures the app's layout.

2. Pages:
   - Main: Houses the RecordButton for quick access to recording functionality.
   - Entries: Placeholder for listing recorded entries.
   - Insights: Placeholder for future AI-driven analysis of recordings.
   - Options: Placeholder for app settings and configurations.

3. Routing: Implemented using React Router for seamless navigation between pages.

4. Styling: Dark mode theme with subtle animations for an elegant, modern look.

Rationale:
- Modular Structure: Components are separated into individual files for better maintainability and scalability.
- Minimalist Design: Focuses user attention on core functionality (recording) while providing easy access to other features.
- Dark Mode: Reduces eye strain and provides a sleek, professional appearance.

Vision:
The goal is to create a sophisticated voice recording app that goes beyond basic functionality. Key aspects of the vision include:

1. Effortless Recording: One-click voice note capture for quick thoughts and ideas.
2. Intelligent Organization: Automatic categorization and tagging of voice notes.
3. AI-Powered Insights: Future implementation of transcription and analysis features to derive meaningful insights from recordings.
4. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensure seamless experience across desktop platforms.
5. Privacy-Focused: Prioritize user data protection and offer local storage options.
6. Expandability: Design the app architecture to easily accommodate future features like cloud sync, sharing, or integration with productivity tools.

Next Steps:
1. Implement core recording functionality.
2. Develop a system for storing and managing voice notes.
3. Create a user interface for browsing and playing back recordings.
4. Begin work on the AI transcription and analysis features.
5. Refine the user interface based on initial user feedback.

This application aims to blend simplicity with powerful features, creating a tool that enhances productivity and creativity through effortless voice capture and intelligent analysis.
